Stuff todo

on :action do
  ...
end

as :role do
end

supports :on in :as and vice-versa

support

secured_params :as => :roll

possibly supply controller as :context for block evals?

with_context do |ctx|
  if ctx.foo?
    ...
  else
    ...
  end
end

perhaps rename stuff to

has_strong_policy
has_strong_policy :through => ClassName

with
policy_params to access

possible better chain implementation so add abritrary policy chains in (to extend strong params with custom stuff)

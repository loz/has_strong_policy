TODO

[ ] - Support: secured_params :as => :roll
[ ] - possibly supply controller as :context for block evals?


perhaps rename stuff to

has_strong_policy
has_strong_policy :through => ClassName

with
policy_params to access

possible better chain implementation so add abritrary policy chains in (to extend strong params with custom stuff)

Context stuff..

with_context do |ctx|
  if ctx.foo?
    ...
  else
    ...
  end
end
